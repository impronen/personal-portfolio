# Personal Portfolio

My developer portfolio, created with React+Vite

The projects themselves are a working progress and will be replaced with more refined ones when they are completed. Similarly the presentation is a rough outline of what the finished portfolio will have.

### Things I intend to improve on

- add some "sizzle" with some animations or added graphical elements
- refine the layout of the project cards
- write proper texts as project introductions
- have real contact information / links to socials in the Contact section
